Hello, getting started with grapping the basic understanding of JS, now i am moving forword, the goal right now is following 
a course named "JavaScript tutorial and Projects" from John Smilga. I also bought his Course about React which i am going to learn right after this.

IMPORTANT. ONLY the Javascript part is the goal of the mentiened tutorial and the Css file is been pre-written.I only typed and fully understand the javaScript part.  

Here is the overview of the DOM objects from John's website: https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/

Codes updated here only indicates my progress in this tutorial and the codes are not original from me although i do typed THE JAVASCRIPT PART by my own following the instruction from John and my own thinking.Copyright saves for John.This is only for any potential empolyer to have a vision of which stage i am stading right now.  

Update-26.7 
Few tinny projects down with John, which are Counter, Reviews and few quite similar projects which are navbar,sidebar and modal.I choose to upload the Counter and Modal in this period.
